useful-icons
============

You may assume this code is part of the public domain. Images were obtained from wikipedia under fair use.

Useful icons and launchers for various programs I install on my system.

This package adds icons and creates a launcher for matlab and
other proprietary programs.
The only requirement is that the be installed in the default directory
for the .desktop file to detect the existance of the program.


They are very easy to install.

Fedora:

    cp -R root/* /
